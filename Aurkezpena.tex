 \item $\omega_{ZA}(|\boldsymbol{q}|)=\alpha|\boldsymbol{q}|+\beta|\boldsymbol{q}|^{2}+\dots$
 \item Rotational invariance (RI) together with the 2D character of $\phi_{ab}$ makes the harmonic dispersion of mode ZA quadratic ($\alpha=0$).

  \item $\langle u^{2}\rangle$ diverges for finite temperatures.
  \item Finite linewidths of LA/TA modes at decreasing momenta. Quasiparticle picture and sound propagation lost

The problems we have mentioned are long standing problems:
\begin{itemize}
\item Perturbation theory predicts a linear dispersion
\item The bending rigidity $\kappa(q)=\omega_{ZA}/q^{2}$ diverges
\end{itemize}
What phonons do we expect from a theoretical point of view?
\begin{itemize}
\item Phonons defined from the free energy $\mathcal{F}$ should be quadratic as the ones defined from the harmonic potential $V$. Both have the same symmetries.
\end{itemize}
What have we done?
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Perform SCHA in an atomistic model using an empirical machine learning potential trained with DFT.
\end{enumerate}
